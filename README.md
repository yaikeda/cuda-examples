# CUDA-Examples

This repository contains experimental implementations for learning and optimizing GPU programs using CUDA.  
All examples are written in **C++ with CUDA**, focusing on performance analysis and architectural understanding.

Each experiment targets specific aspects of CUDA optimization, such as memory access patterns, warp behavior, and kernel launch strategies.

## Goals

- Practice writing and optimizing GPU kernels with CUDA
- Explore real-world performance characteristics (shared memory, warp divergence, etc.)
- Summarize key findings in short blog posts (linked below)

## Blog

Brief write-ups are published on my technical blog:

## Environment

- CUDA Toolkit: 12.6
- Platform: Windows + Power Shell
- Visual Studio: 2022 (not use IDE but cl.exe)
<!--- Profiling: Nsight Systems / Nsight Compute-->
