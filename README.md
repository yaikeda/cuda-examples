# CUDA-Examples

This repository contains experimental implementations for learning and optimizing GPU programs using CUDA.  
All examples are written in **C++ with CUDA**, focusing on performance analysis and architectural understanding.

Each experiment targets specific aspects of CUDA optimization, such as memory access patterns, warp behavior, and kernel launch strategies.

## Goals

- Practice writing and optimizing GPU kernels with CUDA
- Explore real-world performance characteristics (shared memory, warp divergence, etc.)
- Summarize key findings in short blog posts (linked below)

## Blog

Brief write-ups are published on my technical blog:
